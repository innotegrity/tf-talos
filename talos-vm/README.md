# Talos Linux Virtual Machine Module

This module creates a virtual machine running Talos Linux booted from an ISO image.

You can optionally configure this module to reserve an IP address by using a DHCP reservation for the VM.

Supported backends for creating DHCP reservations are:

- Ubiquiti UDM Pro

## Required Providers

- `ivoronin/macaddress` ~> v0.3
- `bpg/proxmox` ~> 0.89
- `ubiquiti-community/unifi` ~> 0.41
